# Tennis Simulation 1.0

  This is a very low and raw model for simulation of the result of the tennis game. Just according to the technical statistics of the players, we simulate a tennis game with the rule.  The statistics of the players used for this model should be related to the level of the opponent. For consideration of the random error, we use random disturbance term, but this should be adjusted by the type of the surface and the number of the sets has been finished. The value of the random disturbance term is decided by myself.

  ATTENTION: The statistics of the player should be related with the surface, level of the opponent and includes: ACE, Double Fault, 1st serve in, 1st serve won, 2nd serve won, Break points save, 1st return won, 2nd return won, Break points convert, Elo of the surface. You can use more terms to improve it .

  With some samples to test, the results is generally convinced. We hope to make more large progress in the future.
